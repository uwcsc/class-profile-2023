And that's all I do on the first day of class. From then on, I make a table labelled Monday through Friday, and put every task to start/continue/finish underneath. This is where the calendar comes in, which will help you prioritize the tasks. On top of that, I couldn't survive a term without study buddies. My keys to success have literally been keep a calendar of due dates, schedule your week, and find people who can help you when you just don't think you can do it.",
